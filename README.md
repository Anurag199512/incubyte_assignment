## Assumptions Made

1. Only one dynamic delimiter will be provided in input in addition to the "\n".
2. Length of delimiter is always 1. For ex we cannot have a delimiter such "--", "++", "###" etc.
3. If while provided dynamic delimiter input is not given in the specified format then output returned will be 0.
